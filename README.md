## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
java --version        # Must show 21
mvn --version         # Must show 3.9+
node --version        # Must show 20+
docker --version
docker compose version
minikube version
claude --version
```

### Run locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:umeshkumarkv/broker-dealer.git
cd broker-dealer
git checkout develop
docker compose up
```

### Verify all services healthy

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health   # API Gateway
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health   # auth-service
curl http://localhost:8082/actuator/health   # order-service
curl http://localhost:8083/actuator/health   # client-service
curl http://localhost:8084/actuator/health   # marketdata-service
curl http://localhost:8085/actuator/health   # risk-service
curl http://localhost:8086/actuator/health   # execution-service
curl http://localhost:8087/actuator/health   # audit-service
```

All must return `{ "status": "UP" }`.

## How Claude Code Works on This Project

### Every Claude Code session opener

```
Read CLAUDE.md and services/{service-name}/CLAUDE.md
fully before writing any code.

You are working on JIRA story BD-{number}.
Story: {paste full story including AI Context,
        Acceptance Criteria, Out of Scope,
        Tech Constraints}

The skeleton is already in place.
Implement within the existing structure only.
Follow openapi.yaml exactly for all endpoints.
Create branch ai/BD-{number}-{description} from develop.
```

### Branch naming

| Branch | Created By | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| ai/BD-{n}-{desc} | Claude Code | Feature stories |
| infra/{desc} | Dev 1 | Infrastructure |
| bootstrap/{desc} | Architect | Skeleton setup |
| hotfix/{desc} | Humans only | Emergency fixes |
